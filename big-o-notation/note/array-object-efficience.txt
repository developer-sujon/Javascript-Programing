Accessing Elements:

Array: O(1) if you know the index. Accessing elements by index is very efficient because it directly calculates the memory address.
Object: O(1) if you know the key. Accessing elements by key (property) is also very efficient because it involves a direct lookup.
Adding/Updating Elements:

Array: O(1) for adding elements to the end of the array using push(). However, adding/removing elements in the middle or beginning of an array is O(n) because it may require shifting elements.
Object: O(1) for adding/updating elements. You can directly assign values to object properties without shifting or reordering.
Removing Elements:

Array: O(n) for removing elements from the middle or beginning of the array because it may require shifting elements.
Object: O(1) for removing elements by key. You can delete object properties directly.
Searching for an Element:

Array: O(n) for searching for an element by value. You typically need to iterate through the array to find a specific value.
Object: O(1) for searching for an element by key (property). It's very efficient to check if an object has a specific key.
Iterating Through All Elements:

Array: O(n) for iterating through all elements. You need to visit each element in the array.
Object: O(n) for iterating through all keys/values. You need to visit each key-value pair in the object.
Ordered vs. Unordered:

Arrays are ordered collections, and elements have a specific index.
Objects are typically unordered collections, and keys (properties) have no specific order.
In summary, if you need to work with a collection of items where you care about the order and you primarily access elements by index, an array is more efficient. On the other hand, if you need to store key-value pairs or perform operations based on keys, an object is more efficient. Each data structure has its strengths, and choosing the right one depends on your specific use case.
