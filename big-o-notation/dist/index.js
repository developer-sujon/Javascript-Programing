// Big O notation, Best Case (Omega), and Average Case complexity.

// Big O Notation (O):
// Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound or worst-case time complexity of an algorithm.
// It represents the maximum number of basic operations an algorithm will perform as a function of the input size.
// It provides an upper limit on how the runtime of an algorithm scales with input size.
// Best Case (Omega):
// Omega notation represents the lower bound or best-case time complexity of an algorithm.
// It represents the minimum number of basic operations an algorithm will perform as a function of the input size.
// It provides a lower limit on how fast an algorithm can be in the best-case scenario.
// Average Case (Θ):
// Theta notation represents the average time complexity of an algorithm.
// It describes the expected or average number of basic operations an algorithm will perform as a function of the input size.
// It provides a balanced view of the algorithm's performance over a range of possible inputs.
// Here's a summary of how these notations relate to the number of operations and input size:

// Big O (O):

// Describes the upper bound or worst-case behavior.
// Represents the maximum number of operations.
// Indicates how the algorithm scales with input size in the worst-case scenario.
// Best Case (Omega):

// Describes the lower bound or best-case behavior.
// Represents the minimum number of operations.
// Indicates how the algorithm performs in the best-case scenario.
// Average Case (Θ):

// Describes the expected or average behavior.
// Represents the typical number of operations.
// Provides a balanced view of the algorithm's performance across various inputs.
// It's important to note that when analyzing algorithms, we often focus on worst-case time complexity (Big O) because it helps us ensure that our algorithms perform reasonably well even when the input is unfavorable. However, best-case and average-case analyses are also valuable, depending on the specific use case and requirements.
