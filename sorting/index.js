/**
 * Sorting is the process of organizing a collection of items in a particular order, often in ascending (from smaller to larger) or descending (from larger to smaller) order. It's a fundamental operation in computer science and data manipulation. Sorting can be applied to various data types, including numbers, strings, and objects.
 */

/**
 * Sorting is essential in various applications, including:
 */

// 1. Data Analysis
// 2. Searching
// 3. Display
// 4. Ranking
// 5. Database Queries

// SORTING (organizing data in order)
// ascending (smaller to larger)
// descending (Larger to smaller)

// [3, 1, 7, 5, 10, 5] - Original array random:
// [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10] - Ascending order (smaller to larger):
// [10, 7, 6, 5, 3, 1] - Descending order (larger to smaller):

/**
 * In programming, you can use built-in sorting functions or algorithms to sort arrays or lists of data in various orders. Common sorting algorithms include:
 */

/**
 * primitive or quadratic sort
 */
// 1. Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
// 2. Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
// 3. Selection Sort: Repeatedly selects the minimum element.

/**
 * more efficient sort
 */
// 4. Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves.
// 5. Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm with a focus on partitioning.
// 6. Heap Sort: Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
// 7. Radix Sort: Sorts elements by processing individual digits or characters of numbers or strings
