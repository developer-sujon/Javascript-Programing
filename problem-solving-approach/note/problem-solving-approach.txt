Problem Solving Approach
1. Understand the Problem:
Begin by carefully reading and understanding the problem statement or prompt. Ensure you have a clear grasp of the problem's requirements.

Identify the inputs and outputs of the problem. What data or information is provided, and what results are expected?

Verify if there is enough information to solve the problem or if you need to make any assumptions.

Choose meaningful names for data and variables instead of using generic labels like "i," "j," or "temp."

Consider how the problem should handle edge cases, such as empty input or invalid data.

2. Devise a Plan:
Think about the initial, native, or brute-force approach that comes to mind for solving the problem.

Evaluate the limitations of the initial approach. Look for issues like high time complexity (e.g., O(n^2)), lack of readability, or inefficiency.

Walk through your proposed algorithm step by step before writing any code. This helps clarify your thinking and identify potential challenges.

Plan your code by documenting the steps you intend to follow. Include comments explaining your thought process and approach.

Break down the code into smaller, manageable steps. Comment on the reasoning behind each step to make implementation and debugging easier.

3. Coding:
Follow the plan you've outlined and begin writing your code based on the documented steps.

Start with a simplified version of the code and gradually add complexity. Avoid trying to write the entire solution all at once.

Prioritize code readability by using clear variable names, consistent indentation, and meaningful comments.

Optimize the code for efficiency in terms of both time and space complexity as needed.

4. Testing and Debugging:
Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including normal cases and edge cases.

Verify that your solution produces the correct results for all test cases.

Debug and address any issues or errors that arise during testing. Use debugging tools as necessary.

5. Optimization and Refactoring:
Analyze the code for potential optimizations, especially if you notice bottlenecks in terms of time or space complexity.

Refactor the code to make it more efficient and maintainable while preserving correctness.

6. Documentation:
Add comments and documentation to your code to explain its logic, purpose, and any important considerations.

Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.

7. Review and Seek Feedback:
Review your code and solution to ensure it meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Seek feedback from peers, mentors, or colleagues to gain different perspectives and improve your approach.

8. Conclusion:
After successfully solving the problem, take time to reflect on your approach and what you've learned.

Consider how you can apply the problem-solving techniques you've used to other challenges in the future.

This structured problem-solving approach can help you tackle a wide range of problems effectively and efficiently. Remember that practice and continuous learning are key to becoming a better problem solver.
