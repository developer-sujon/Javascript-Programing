  - what are the input and output
  - Is there enough information to solve the problem
  - Thinking of labeling data (don't use random label like i, j, k, a, b, etc)
  - Checking the example with invalid empty input

- Note Own the details like input, output and outcome
- stent with the native/brute force approach, Fist thing that comes into ming, It Shows that critically (you do't meed to write this code, just speak about it)
- Tell them why this approach is is not the best O(n^2) or higher, not readable
- Walk through you Approach is comment things and see where you may
- Before you start coding, walk through your code write down the Steps your are going to follow.
- Breakdown the Steps and comment thinking process, steps, Breaking down the code will your give you the extra advantage,
- Start coding (simplify as necessary)
- Can you write it better in terns of Readability, time, space complexity
- If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interviewer usually ends here it is also common must the interviewer ask you extension questions.
